The idea is, that on this server an algorithm similar to the inter-phone message exchange algorithms runs, so phones can exchange message with the 
server just like with a nearby device.

It was originally meant to be integrated into a 3rd party server software of the RESIBES project. Without that you can just use it as a standalone variant with InMemoryDatastores.
